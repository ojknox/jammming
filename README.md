## Overview

The aim of the project was to build a React App where you can create custom playlists that combines multiple components, interactive search functionality, and requests to the Spotify API.

Users should be able to:

- Search for a song & see results relating to their seach query
- Add songs to their new custom playlist
- Save their new playlist to their spotify account
- N.B. Full functionality only works if I add the user to the app in the Spotify Developer dashboard
